## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Build Requirements**
- CMake 3.22+
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2022)
- Git (for dependency management)

### **Build Instructions**
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/mixmind-ai.git
cd mixmind-ai

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run MixMind AI
./MixMindAI
```

### **Development Build**
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build . --config Debug
ctest                  # Run tests
```

## 🎵 Usage

### **REST API**
```bash
# Start session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/session/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Song", "sampleRate": 48000}'

# Add track  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/track/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Vocals", "type": "audio"}'
```

### **Voice Commands**
```
"Hey MixMind, create a new session called 'My Song'"
"Add an audio track named 'Vocals'"  
"Start playback"
"Set the tempo to 120 BPM"
```

### **WebSocket Real-time**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8081');
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  action: "transport.play",
  parameters: {}
}));
```
